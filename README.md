# Abstract

We've seen Lists, Trees and IO. But what have they got in common? It turns out, lots!

In this section we'll introduce the Functor Typeclass to allow us to write generic functions that work for all of these types, and many more! This is one of many of the powerful abstractions commonly used in Haskell to make our code concise and expressive, as well as save us from boring repetition.
